# Advanced Recipe: Correlation Matrix (Heatmap)
## Family (Purpose): Correlation
## Data Pattern: 3 Numeric (Matrix)
## Difficulty: Advanced

## Suitability
Displays correlation intensity between variables. Essential for multi-dimensional data exploration.

## Data Schema (Tier 1)
- **Format:** Mandatory 'Long Format' (ADR-002). The matrix MUST be pivoted to 3 columns: `var1`, `var2`, and the numeric `correlation` value.
- **Headers:** id, var1, var2, correlation

## Transformation Logic (Tier 2)
- This recipe utilizes advanced layer stacking and coordinate manipulation.
